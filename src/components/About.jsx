        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <div>
          I grew up in Iowa City, Iowa, graduated from a technical college, and
          worked as a fire alarm systems designer for most of my 20s. In 2019, I
          made the decision to change careers. I worked through most of the
          Computer Science program at the University of Missouri - Kansas City
          (with excellent grades and while working 40+ hours per week) until I
          had to leave for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A year
          later, having settled in the Salt Lake City area, I learned the
          remaining necessary skills to be a full stack developer by attending
          Fullstack Academy.

          <div>
            I love keeping a variety of aquatic creatures! We currently have
            four different betta community tanks, a guppy tank, and a shrimp
            tank.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm also spinning up my first saltwater tank!
